            <p>
                The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each
                day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades
                take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout
                New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
            </p>
            <p>
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well
                known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for
                naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for
                naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
                African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws
                are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the
                same parade schedule and route each year.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and
                Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St.
                Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River
                in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of
                the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music
                and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). An account from 1743 that the custom of
                Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras
                took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions
                were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation
                owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1856 six businessmen gathered at a club room in New Orleans's French Quarter to organize a secret
                society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe,
                the Mystick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its
                celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a
                clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to
                Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a
                certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
                how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead
                in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the
                course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using
                Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a
                New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
            </p>
            <p>
                1972 was the last year in which large parades went through the narrow streets of the city's French
                Quarter section; larger floats, crowds, and fire safety concerns led the city government to prohibit
                parades in the Quarter. Major parades now skirt the French Quarter along Canal Street.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
                surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the
                city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining
                order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws
                regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community recall
                1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion,
                gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the
                law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the
                long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and
                because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership
                lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992
                Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment
                rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the
                ordinance. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.
            </p>
            <p>
                The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question the
                future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006,
                tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of
                Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration
                to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready
                to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule.
                It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through
                Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were
                several parades on Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed
                daily from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going
                through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal
                Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Some krewes unsuccessfully
                pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered by that
                neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end.
                National Guard troops assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State
                troopers also assisted, as they have many times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in
                floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others
                incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's
                aftermath. Many had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more
                intense as an affirmation of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than
                usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city. References
                included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency
                Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding
                their parades Uptown.
